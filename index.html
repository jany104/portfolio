            <p>Created during the fun-filled Hack @ Arch ‚ÄúUseless Hackathon‚Äù, Rage Type Tester is a typing test with an unexpected twist ‚Äî as you type, random words in the prompt start to change, making it harder to complete the task. The idea was to mess with user expectations in a fun and chaotic way, challenging focus and speed in an unconventional setting. A creative experiment in user interaction and front-end behavior.</p>
